# Text_reminder
Conceptual version of a simple memorizing game

## How it's working?
 - To the txt file you put the definition of something (using a hyphen as a delimiter of the definition from the content)
 - (For now) in the code you set how many words are to be hidden
 - Run and enjoy the game. Getting nervous with typos.
 - After three tries, you realize that it is enough to uncomment one line to see the answers. You mock the programmer
